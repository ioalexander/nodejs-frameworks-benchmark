# Nodejs frameworks benchmark

Here I'm benchmarking different nodejs backend frameworks. I want to measure memory and cpu footprint and their performance.

Check out results and download them here: https://ioalexander.github.io/nodejs-frameworks-benchmark/

## Development

```sh
cd benchmark # go to benchmark folder
yarn install  # install its dependencies
yarn intalll:all # install dependencies of all frameworks
yarn build:all # build all frameworks
yarn start:benchmark # run benchmark
cd ../frontend # go to frontend folder
yarn install # install its dependencies
yarn dev # serve the page on ::3000
```
